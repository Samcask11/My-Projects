This repository contains 5 of the programs I have created in python, which are as follows;


Tetris

This program is a simple replica of Tetris. Arrow keys can be used to control the movement of the shapes as they fall.


Starship Revived

Likely my most in depth project to date, Starship Revived is a roguelike game where you shoot aliens to earn points that you can spend on upgrades. The end goal is to obtain as many points as possible before you are inevitably blown up by the aliens. The controls of the game can be viewed and altered in settings.


Procedural Test

I made this program in order to test the creation of a few different game mechanics, including smooth movement, procedural generation and basic pathfinding. The W, A, S, and D keys can be used to move throughout the world.


Neural Network Test

This is one of my first attempts at artificial intelligence, where I created a neural network that can play a simple game, where the goal is to collect green and blue squares while avoiding red squares. The space key can be pressed to toggle between generation and individual view.


Enigma Machine

This program is an attempt to mirror the encryption method of the Enigma Machine, a famous encryptor utilised by in WWII, where the encryption method was different for every letter. 3 rotors must be selected by entering numbers from 1 to 5, followed by the initial rotation of the rotors, determined by entering numbers from 1 to 26.
